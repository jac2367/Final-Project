				<p>The deadline for the 2015 cFUND Ignition Grant application is on April 30 by 11:59 pm. Each venture team will be required to submit executive business summaries by the April 30 deadline via YouNoodle.
				cFUND Ignition Grants are financial grants to assist Columbia University current undergraduate and graduate SEAS students in launching new businesses, social and not-for-profit ventures. cFUND Ignition Grants support the initial stages of early venture development from formation, IP protection, and incubation to building prototypes and creating proofs of concept.  
				There are three levels of Ignition Grants: Formation ($5K), Incubation ($10K), and Pre-Seed ($20-50K).
				$5K Formation Level: $5,000 grants that allow ventures that have demonstrated sufficient seriousness and have well-defined teams to pay for incorporation, founders' agreements, trademark searches, domain names, etc.
				$10K Incubation Level: $10,000 grants for well-formed teams to offset incubation expenses including one year at Columbia Startup Lab facilities and non-salary operating expenses.
				$25K-50K Pre-Seed Level: $25,000-$50,000 grants allow the most advanced teams do the work necessary to empirically prove market acceptance, affirm the underlying assumptions of their business model and / or build a prototype
				Last year, thirteen early-stage student startups collectively received $133,000 in cFUND Ignition Grants. Grant recipients' startup ideas ranged from new text-to-image software, innovative health care web applications, and 3D sculpture reproductions brought directly to the user, including Wordseye, Neuroscout,  Cheddar, and Medicotravel.

				<p class="titles">Apply for Harvard Business School's Summer Venture in Management Program</p>
				<p><b>Application Deadline:</b> May 11, 2015<br>
				The Harvard Business School (HBS) Summer Venture in Management Program (SVMP) is a one-week management training program for rising college seniors designed to increase diversity and opportunity in business education. This thirty-year HBS tradition demonstrates the many rewards of an MBA degree to students who may not otherwise have considered this path. Participants spend a week on campus living the MBA student experience – attending classes, analyzing case studies, and debating management issues with peers and faculty.

				This unique educational experience gives participants a broader understanding of the challenges business leaders face, the innumerable opportunities that exist in management, and the impact they can have on their community and the world with a graduate business education.</p>

				<p>Participants will be selected based on academic achievement, demonstrated leadership, and personal characteristics. Consistent with the objective of promoting educational diversity and opportunity in business leadership, additional criteria to be considered among others, are whether the applicant is:
					<ul>
						<li>The first family member to attend college</li><br>
						<li>A member of a group that is currently underrepresented in business schools and corporate America (e.g. African-American, Latino, Native American, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, or Transgender)</li><br>
						<li>From a family with little business education or experience; and/or</li><br>
						<li>From a school whose graduates do not typically attend a top-tier university (e.g., attends a rural or predominantly minority college, or has attended a community college as part of a four-year degree)</li><br>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<p>The SVMP Application will be available online in February 2015. The application deadline is Monday, May 11, 2015. To apply to and for more information about SVMP, please visit the <a href="www.hbs.edu/svmp">program's website</a><br>
